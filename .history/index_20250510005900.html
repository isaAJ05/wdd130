            <p>My name is Isabella Arrieta, I’m 19 years old, and I’m from the beautiful city of Barranquilla, Colombia. I enrolled in BYU Pathway because I feel inspired to do so. I love coding (something I never imagined choosing as a career when I was a kid). However, when the pandemic came, I discovered programming, and I truly enjoyed it.
 
I still have a lot to learn, which is why I’m here. I want to gain as much knowledge as possible, and I feel very grateful that I can do so through BYU-Idaho. This is a wonderful opportunity, and I am excited to work hard. One of my goals is to help my family through my work and to serve God in the best way I can. I will put forth my best effort, and it’s a pleasure to be here with all of you</p>
